      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The HP G5 is the earliest chromebook still in use by the district - it features black plastic entirely around the edges, and a silver colored keyboard deck. This model is known for being the most reliable, but least durable, of the models we use.</p>

      <h2>Common Issues</h2>
      <p>The G5 has two common problems:</p>
      <p>Shell chipping - the chromebook's edges will chip off and break. (As seen in image)</p>
      <p>Charge ports - the blue-tipped barrel charge port on the side will lose it's cap, exposing the pins and leaving it unable to charge.</p>
      <p>Neither of these issues are easy to prevent, but as long as the device is well cared for, they are unlikely to happen. Avoiding dropping the laptop or ripping the cable out is advised.</p>

      <h2>Bezel Removal</h2>
      <p>In order to replace the display on any of the chromebooks, you first have to remove the bezel. The bezel on the G5 is easily pried off at the corners once the two screws at bottom of the device are removed. (As pictured) Both screws are covered by small black stickers.</p>

      <h2>Keyboard Removal</h2>
      <p>If you want access to the internals or if you wish to replace the keyboard in it's entirety, you begin by unscrewing 11 screws total on the rear - five are in view, two at the top are covered by small rubber stickers, and the last four are underneath the rubber feet of the laptop.</p>
